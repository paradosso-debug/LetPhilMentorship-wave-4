// 🧠 Step 1: Use document.getElementById to select the dropdown element
// - The <select> element should have id="languageSelect"

// 💾 Step 2: Load any previously saved language from localStorage
// - Check if localStorage has a key called "language"
// - If it exists, set the dropdown's value to that saved language

// 📝 Step 3: Save the selected language whenever the dropdown changes
// - Add an event listener for the "change" event on the dropdown
// - When the user selects a new language, store it in localStorage
