## 🎯 Your Goal

Build a webpage titled **“My Weekly Schedule”** that:

## 📝 Tips

- Use the `border="1"` attribute in `<table>` to make the borders visible
- Make sure each row (`<tr>`) has the same number of cells (`<th>` or `<td>`) to keep it aligned
- Use meaningful activity names for a personal touch
