# 📘 Project 7: Simple Web Article Layout

In this project, you’ll learn to use **semantic HTML tags** that describe the meaning of the content they contain. Semantic tags help structure pages in a way that’s easy to understand—for both developers and search engines.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

- What semantic HTML tags are and why they matter
- How to structure a page using `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`
- How to group different parts of a webpage in a meaningful way

## 🧱 Tags Introduced

| Tag         | Purpose                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `<header>`  | Top section of the page (often with title or nav) |
| `<nav>`     | Navigation links                                  |
| `<main>`    | Main content of the page                          |
| `<section>` | A logical group of related content                |
| `<article>` | A self-contained piece of content                 |
| `<aside>`   | Extra info, side notes, quotes, etc.              |
| `<footer>`  | Page footer with copyright/info                   |

(Also continues using: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<!DOCTYPE>`)

## 🎯 Your Goal

Build a simple blog-style layout that includes:

- A `<header>` with the site title and a `<nav>` with 2–3 links
- A `<main>` section with:

  - A `<section>` containing:

    - An `<article>` with an `<h2>` and a paragraph
    - An `<aside>` with a quote or side note

- A `<footer>` with your name and copyright year

## 💡 Example Output (Structure Only)

```
[Header: My Web Journal | Home | About | Contact]
[Main Section]
  ├─ [Article: Title + Paragraph]
  └─ [Aside: Fun quote]
[Footer: © 2025 Your Name]
```

## 📝 Tips

- Think of semantic tags as **labels** that describe sections of your page
- Use `<aside>` for small, related details not central to the main content
- `<nav>` can include real or dummy links using `<a href="#">Text</a>`
