-- Step 2: Add a <head> with a <title> like "My Mini Site - Home"
-- Step 3: In the <body>, add a <header> with your name and a <nav> with a link to Page 2
-- Step 4: Add a <main> section with:
    -- An <h1> heading for the homepage title
    -- A <p> about who you are
    -- An <img> that represents you (can be from a URL or placeholder)
-- Step 5: Add a <footer> with your contact info or copyright
-- Step 6: Save as index.html and check in the browser

ðŸŽ¯ Make sure your <a> in the <nav> links to your second HTML page (e.g., hobbies.html or secondpage.html)
