Project 8: Personal Mini Site 
File: secondpage.html (Page 2)
=====================================

ðŸ§  GOAL: Create a second page for your personal mini site.
This can be about your hobbies, projects, favorite books, or anything you like!

-- Step 1: Start with <!DOCTYPE html> and the <html> structure
-- Step 2: Add a <head> with a <title> like "My Mini Site - Page 2"
-- Step 3: In the <body>, add a <header> with your name and a <nav> that links back to index.html
-- Step 4: Add a <main> section with:
    -- A <section> or <article> describing your hobbies or interests
    -- Use at least one <ul> or <ol> list to describe favorites or steps
    -- Add at least one <img> related to your topic
-- Step 5: Add a <footer> with your name and copyright
-- Step 6: Save as secondpage.html and test both pages by clicking the links

ðŸŽ¯ Link between index.html and secondpage.html using <a href="..."> tags

ðŸ“¦ Tags to use: All that you've learned so far â€” especially <ul>, <ol>, <section>, <article>, <img>, <nav>, and <footer>
