## ðŸŽ¯ Your Goal

Create a **2-page personal mini website** with:

### âœ… Page 1: Home (`index.html`)

- A `<header>` with your name and a `<nav>` that links to Page 2
- A `<main>` with an `<h1>`, a short paragraph about you, and an image
- A `<footer>` with your name and copyright

### âœ… Page 2 (`secondpage.html`)

- A `<header>` with your name and a `<nav>` that links back to the homepage
- A `<main>` section describing your hobbies, favorite things, or projects
- Use of a list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`) and at least one image
- A `<footer>` with your name again

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Use placeholder images if you don't have one yet (e.g., [https://via.placeholder.com/300](https://via.placeholder.com/300))
- Check your links â€” make sure `index.html` and `secondpage.html` can navigate back and forth
- Save both files in the same folder so the links work correctly
